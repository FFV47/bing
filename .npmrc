# Security Configuration

# ****** Important Note ******
# With ignore-scripts=true, some packages that require native compilation (like puppeteer which
# downloads Chromium) won't work automatically. You can:
# 1. Run scripts for trusted packages explicitly:
# pnpm rebuild puppeteer
# 2. Or temporarily allow scripts for a single install:
# pnpm install --ignore-scripts=false some-package

# Disable lifecycle scripts to prevent malicious post-install attacks
ignore-scripts=true

# Disable package-lock changes from being automatically installed
package-lock=true

# Audit packages on install
audit=true

# Set audit level to moderate (fail on moderate+ vulnerabilities)
audit-level=moderate

# Disable funding messages (cleaner output)
fund=false

# Prefer offline mode when packages are cached
prefer-offline=true

# Strict SSL verification
strict-ssl=true

# Save exact versions (avoid unexpected updates)
save-exact=true

# Don't save packages to dependencies by default (explicit saves only)
save=false

# Prevent npm from creating symlinks
bin-links=false

# Disable update notifier
update-notifier=false

# Engine strict mode - fail if node version doesn't match
engine-strict=true
